  /**
   * Solve the board by filling all empty fields. Returns None if board can't be solved. If the board is ambiguous,
   * any solution is acceptable.
   * Sudoku rules:
   * - fields need to be filled with number from 1 to 9
   * - each line must not contain a number twice
   * - each row must not contain a number twice
   * - each cluster of 9 cells (3x3, aligned on multiples of 3) must not contain a number twice
   *
   * Example for the top-left cell (cells with X affected by rules, O not)
   * X X X | X X X | X X X
   * X X X | O O O | O O O
   * X X X | O O O | O O O
   * =====================
   * X O O | O O O | O O O
   * X O O | O O O | O O O
   * X O O | O O O | O O O
   * =====================
   * X O O | O O O | O O O
   * X O O | O O O | O O O
   * X O O | O O O | O O O
